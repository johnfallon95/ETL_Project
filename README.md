Project for Rice Data Analytics

# Data Sources
1. Historical MLB data in SQL form from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics.
2. Draft data of #1 overall picks in CSV form from https://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/.

# Extraction
All of the data was publicly available and somewhat easy to extract. The list of first overall draft picks was available in excel format which was easily converted into CSV form. The Lahman baseball archive data was in a SQL database and ready to run after downloading.
