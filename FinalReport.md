# ETL_Project
Project for Rice Data Analytics

# Data Sources
1. Historical MLB data in SQL form from http://www.seanlahman.com/baseball-archive/statistics.
2. Draft data of #1 overall picks in CSV form from https://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/.

The data I chose for transformation was very comprehensive. The Lahman dataset had basically every useful metric for analysis of player performance over the game's entire history. Because I had all the data I could possibly want, I did not need to combine many different data sources, it was already in a clear dataset.

# Ectraction
All of the data was publicly available and somewhat easy to extract. The list of first overall draft picks was available in excel format which was easily converted into CSV form. The Lahman baseball archive data was in a SQL database and ready to run after downloading.
